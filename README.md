# ideaBox
### Abstract:
The IdeaBox provides a simple yet effective way for users to create, manage, and organize their ideas, with the ability to star their most valued ideas. The application allows you to input an idea with a title and a body. When users click the save button, a new idea card is created and displayed in the idea container. Then users can decide to star or delete their idea card.

### Installation Instructions:
To get the application running you must 
* Fork the repository from GitHub

### Context:
As a group, the three of us dedicated approximately five hours daily throughout the last six days to our project. Our collaborative approach involved working over Zoom. Initially we began our sessions addressing an issue collectively, and then muting our microphones as we individually tackled specific features.  We are currently entering the fifth week of Module 1.
